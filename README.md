I definitely got first-hand experience with encapsulating and generalization with this lab.
I started the lab with very specific code that only worked for my one specific pumpkin.
THen when I got to the point where I wanted to draw multiple pumpkins with different scales, the
positions of everything got totally messed up. I wish I was warned about being sure to generalize
my code before I had gotten it all working and then realized it was too specific and had to rewrite
everything.

I understand that the pumpkins are not perfect or identical however as far as art goes I think its 
nice to have variation in the subjects, it adds character. I know some would have the urge to draw
3 identical pumpkins with varying scales but if were going for aesthetic I prefer the variation.
